## INFO ##

Boilerplate project to create Selenium tests. Project builds with Gradle, uses JUnit5 test framework and logging happens with Google Flogger. From here it's pretty easy to continue to develop more different types of GUI tests.

# Selenium

Selenium runs automated tests through the website.

## Plans
- Create more tests
- Use it in Docker, Jetty or Tomcat perhaps and run it on an almost complete web application.

## Note: 
You have to download the webdrivers yourself. You can get the chromedrivers for example from here: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
